<h1>Blink1Control Help</h1><br>
Blink1Control is the primary user-level application for controlling blink(1). <br>
It is an event-based system, where events on your computer or on <br>
the Net (via IFTTT!) can trigger color patterns on the blink(1).<br>
<br>

  <li>Application Layout</li>
  <li>Tray / Menu Icon functions</li>
</ul>


<h2>QuickStart: Connecting IFTTT to your blink(1)</h2>
IFTTT is an Internet-based service that connects other Net-based systems together.<br>
IFTTT communicates with Blink1Control via "Rule names": IFTTT sends an event with<br>
a given rule name and Blink1Control looks for events with matching rule names.&nbsp; <br>
If the rule names match, Blink1Control will play the color pattern you've chosen.<br>
<br>
On the IFTTT site, the rule name is specified in the blink(1) action of your recipe.<br>
<br>
The general steps to hook IFTTT to Blink1Control are:<br>

<ol>
  <li>Get IFTTT Key from Blink1Control</li>
  <li>Activate the blink(1) channel on IFTTT</li>
  <li>Create an IFTTT recipe </li>
  <li>Configure Blink1Control to watch for recipe</li>
</ol>


<h3>1. Get IFTTT Key from Blink1Control</h3>
On the left side of Blink1Control is the "Device" area with the "IFTTT key".&nbsp; <br>
The IFTTT key is 16 hexadecimal characters.<br>
Double-click the IFTTT key and press Ctrl-C / Cmd-C to copy it to your clipboard.<br>
This number is what IFTTT uses to uniquely identify your blink(1).<br>

<h3>2. Activate blink(1) Channel on IFTTT</h3>
Visit IFTTT.com and create an account for free.<br>
Click on "Channels" then the "blink(1)" channel.<br>
Click the Activate button and type in the IFTTT key from Blink1Control.<br>
Click Activate once more and your blink(1) channel is now set up.<br>

<h3>3. Create an IFTTT Recipe</h3>
To test everything out, let's create a really simple recipe where IFTTT listens for email from you <br>
and then sends an event to your blink(1).<br>
<br>
Go to "My Recipes" on IFTTT and click "Create a Recipe".&nbsp; <br>
Pick the "Email" trigger (the "this") and then "blink(1)" action (the "that").<br>
<br>

<br>
<img src="ifttt-recipe3a.png" alt=""><img src="ifttt-recipe4a.png" alt=""><br>
For the blink(1) action, there's a single field called "Rule name".&nbsp; This is the important bit.<br>
Make up a rule name that's short and indicates what this recipe is about.&nbsp; In this example, it's "<span style="font-weight: bold;">my_first_rule</span>".<br>
This is what you will also type in Blink1Control later.<br>
<img src="ifttt-recipe5a.png" alt=""><br>
Click on "Create Action" and then "Create Recipe" and you are done on the IFTTT site.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>4. Configure Blink1Control to watch for recipe<br>
</h3>
Back in Blink1Control, click on the "IFTTT" tab and then the "+" button to add a new blank IFTTT rule.<br>

Once you add a rule, the Recent Events area on the left will show any newly received IFTTT events.&nbsp; <br>

(You might see a "Channel Activated" event from IFTTT. This indicates that Blink1Control has succesfully talked with IFTTT)<br>
<br>
Double-click on the rule name, type in the rule name you used on IFTTT ("my_rule_name" in this case) and press Enter . <br>
And pick a color pattern you like to play on the blink(1) when the recipe fires.<br>
<br>
<img src="ifttt-blink1control1a.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
Now send a mail to "trigger@ifttt.com" from the email address IFTTT is expecting and your blink(1) will blink!<br>
You will also see the event in the Recent Events list.<br>
<br>

<br>
You can create more recipes using IFTTT.&nbsp; But be aware, as IFTTT says on their About page:<br>
<br>
<strong><cite>"Most Personal Recipes check for new Trigger data every 15 minutes, some are even faster." </cite></strong><br>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Application Layout</h2>


The Blink1Control application has two status areas on the left, a color picker and color pattern chooser on the bottom, <br>
and a set of control pages under tabs on the right.<br>
<br>
<img src="blink1control-intro-noted.png" style="width: 700px; height: 455px;" alt=""><br>
<br>
The parts of the main Blink1Control page:<br>
A. Virtual blink(1) -- Reflects what's going on the real blink(1) device<br>
B. Serial number and IFTTT key -- Useful when setting up IFTTT<br>
C. Recent events list -- Any of the event monitors log their activity here<br>
D. Fixed BigButtons -- Common tasks and fun toys for immediate playing with blink(1)<br>
E. Customizable BigButtons -- Assign these to your own colors or patterns, right-click to configure them.<br>
F. Color Picker -- Pick the colors, fade times, and which LED you want to control.<br>
G. Color pattern list -- Blink1Control comes with some stock patterns, but you can make your own. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>System Tray / Menubar Icon</h2>Blink1Control is designed to be minimized, so it presents a System Tray (Windows) / Menu bar (Mac) icon.<br>
Clicking on the icon (right-clicking on Windows) gives a menu of startup options and info.<br>
<br>

<img src="blink1control-taskbar-win1.png" alt=""><img src="blink1control-taskbar-mac1.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
<br>

These options are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>"Start minimized" -- on next startup, don't show the main window</li>
  <li>"Start at login" -- auto-run Blink1Control next time this user logs in</li>
  <li>"Enable API Server" -- enable the HTTP REST API server to control blink(1)</li>
  <li>"Open Settings" -- opens the main window</li>
  <li>"Reset Alerts" -- cancels any currently playing color patterns and makes the blink(1) go dark</li>
</ul>
