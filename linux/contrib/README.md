gmail-to-blink1.sh
------------------
Blinks your Blink(1) when you have unread Gmail!

Checks your Gmail account and blinks the Blink(1) with a definable flash of color (default: bright blue) if you have any unread mail.

Additionally, adds a quick initial burst of a second color (default: red) before the regular flash to indicate when you have more unread mail than a definable amount (default: 10 but can also be disabled)
