In order to use OpenWebKitSharp in your application you should follow the following steps:

1. Open your project and reference OpenWebKitSharp.dll and WebKit.Interop.dll
2. Go to the webkit folder of the OpenWebKitSharp solution, select all the files and copy them to your build directory. There are some files
that you do not need. These files will be present if you build the example projects and are the following:
- CustomMenuImplementation.exe
- CustomMenuImplementation.pdb
- OpenWebKitSharp Test.exe
- OpenWebKitSharp Test.pdb
- OpenWebKitSharp Test.vshost.exe
- OpenWebKitSharp Test.vshost.pdb


3. Go again to your project and select Choose Items at the Visual Studio toolbox. Then locate OpenWebKitSharp.dll so that you can use the WebKitBrowser object with your application.
4. You are ready to use OpenWebKitSharp 2.0!
