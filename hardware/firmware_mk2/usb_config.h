//Select an endpoint ping-pong bufferring mode.  Some microcontrollers only
//support certain modes.  For most applications, it is recommended to use either 
//the USB_PING_PONG__FULL_PING_PONG or USB_PING_PONG__EP0_OUT_ONLY options.  
//The other settings are supported on some devices, but they are not 
//recommended, as they offer inferior control transfer timing performance.  
//See inline code comments in usb_device.c for additional details.
//Enabling ping pong bufferring on an endpoint generally increases firmware
//overhead somewhat, but when both buffers are used simultaneously in the 
//firmware, can offer better sustained bandwidth, especially for OUT endpoints.
//------------------------------------------------------
//#define USB_PING_PONG_MODE USB_PING_PONG__NO_PING_PONG    //Not recommended
#define USB_PING_PONG_MODE USB_PING_PONG__FULL_PING_PONG    //A good all around setting
//#define USB_PING_PONG_MODE USB_PING_PONG__EP0_OUT_ONLY    //Another good setting

//Select a USB stack operating mode.  In the USB_INTERRUPT mode, the USB stack
//main task handler gets called only when necessary as an interrupt handler.
//This can potentially minimize CPU utilization, but adds context saving
//and restoring overhead associated with interrupts, which can potentially 
//decrease performance.
//When the USB_POLLING mode is selected, the USB stack main task handler
//(ex: USBDeviceTasks()) must be called periodically by the application firmware
//at a minimum rate as described in the inline code comments in usb_device.c.

//Option to enable auto-arming of the status stage of control transfers, if no
//"progress" has been made for the USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT value.
//If progress is made (any successful transactions completing on EP0 IN or OUT)
//the timeout counter gets reset to the USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT value.
//
//During normal control transfer processing, the USB stack or the application 
//firmware will call USBCtrlEPAllowStatusStage() as soon as the firmware is finished
//processing the control transfer.  Therefore, the status stage completes as 
//quickly as is physically possible.  The USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS 
//feature, and the USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT value are only relevant, when:
//1.  The application uses the USBDeferStatusStage() API function, but never calls
//      USBCtrlEPAllowStatusStage().  Or:
//2.  The application uses host to device (OUT) control transfers with data stage,
//      and some abnormal error occurs, where the host might try to abort the control
//      transfer, before it has sent all of the data it claimed it was going to send.
//
//If the application firmware never uses the USBDeferStatusStage() API function,
//and it never uses host to device control transfers with data stage, then
//it is not required to enable the USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS feature.

#define USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS    //Comment this out to disable this feature.  

//Section 9.2.6 of the USB 2.0 specifications indicate that:
//1.  Control transfers with no data stage: Status stage must complete within 
//      50ms of the start of the control transfer.
//2.  Control transfers with (IN) data stage: Status stage must complete within 
//      50ms of sending the last IN data packet in fullfilment of the data stage.
//3.  Control transfers with (OUT) data stage: No specific status stage timing
//      requirement.  However, the total time of the entire control transfer (ex:
//      including the OUT data stage and IN status stage) must not exceed 5 seconds.
//
//Therefore, if the USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS feature is used, it is suggested
//to set the USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT value to timeout in less than 50ms.  If the
//USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS feature is not enabled, then the USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT
//parameter is not relevant.

#define USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT     (BYTE)45   //Approximate timeout in milliseconds, except when
                                                //USB_POLLING mode is used, and USBDeviceTasks() is called at < 1kHz
                                                //In this special case, the timeout becomes approximately:
//Timeout(in milliseconds) = ((1000 * (USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT - 1)) / (USBDeviceTasks() polling frequency in Hz))
