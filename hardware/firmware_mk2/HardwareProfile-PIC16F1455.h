    //The PIC16F145x devices have an internal oscillator that can be used with USB.
    //However, if this feature is used when the PIC16F1459 is plugged into
    //the original Low Pin Count Development Kit demo board (originally intended
    //for use with the PIC18F14K50 microcontroller), an additional
    //capacitor (of recommended value 1uF to 8uF, ceramic perferred) needs to be
    //soldered onto the PCB, directly on top of/in parallel with the existing
    //capacitor C1 (which is 0.1uF).  Without this modification, the original
    //Low Pin Count Development Kit board has very little total capacitance on
    //the VBUS/VDD net, consisting of only two 0.1uF caps.  For some
    //applications, this amount of capacitance can be sufficient, provided that
    //there are no noise generating sources on the PCB.  In practice, the
    //Low Pin Count Development Kit board has a RS-232 level translator chip (U3)
    //used for UART communication.  This circuit uses a capacitive charge pump for
    //generating positive and negative voltages associated with RS-232 signaling.
    //However, this charge pumping action generates strong noise on the VDD rail,
    //which the 0.1uF capacitors are not large enough to fully suppress.
    //As a result, strong ripple/noise (exceeding 600mV peak to peak, with fast
    //slew rate at times in excess of 2V/us) is present on the VDD net supplying
    //the microcontroller.  When operated in HS+PLL mode with the crystal, the
    //microcontroller is quite tolerant of this VDD ripple/noise, and is able
    //to communicate reliably over the USB connection.  However, when operated in
    //HFINTOSC + PLL mode, the strong VDD rail ripple/noise can inject noise into
    //the oscillator circuit, resulting in higher than normal jitter levels.
    //Therefore, this VDD noise can potentially result in USB packet corruption.
    //This PCB design flaw can be fully avoided by adding additional capacitance
    //(of at least 1uF) in parallel with the existing capacitor C1, thereby
    //smoothing/suppressing the VDD rail ripple/noise generated by the charge
    //pump circuit U3.  When the VDD rail is smooth, the HFINTOSC + PLL with
    //active clock tuning can be used for reliable USB communication.

    #define USE_INTERNAL_OSC  //Make sure to add 1+uF capacitance to VDD net
                                //before uncommenting this option.  See comments
