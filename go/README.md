Go libraries for blink(1)
=========================

There are two known libraries for blink(1):
* [GoBlink](./GoBlink) - original library, in this directory
* [go-blink1](https://github.com/hink/go-blink1) - new library by [@hink](https://github.com/hink) at https://github.com/hink/go-blink1

The original `GoBlink` library is a few years old now and doesn't support as many blink(1) features.

The new `go-blink1` library is go-gettable and is more actively supported.
