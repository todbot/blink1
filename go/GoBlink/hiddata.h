General Description:
This module implements an abstraction layer for data transfer over HID feature
requests. The implementation uses native Windows functions on Windows so that
no driver installation is required and libusb on Unix. You must link the
appropriate libraries in either case: "-lhid -lusb -lsetupapi" on Windows and
`libusb-config --libs` on Unix.

 * and '*device' is set to an opaque pointer representing the device. The
 * device must be closed with usbhidCloseDevice(). If the device has not been
 * found or opening failed, an error code is returned.

 * 'len' to the total size of this buffer. Upon successful return, the report
 * (prefixed with the report-ID) is in 'buffer' and the actual length of the
 * report is returned in '*len'.
 * Returns: 0 on success, an error code otherwise.
